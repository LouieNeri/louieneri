Hello there! I'm Louie Neri, a nurse researcher passionate about translating scientific evidence into practical healthcare solutions. Currently, I'm a Researcher at Examine.com, analyzing nutrition science research. Previously, I was the Senior Coordinator of Evidence Based Surgery at The Society of Thoracic Surgeons where I managed clinical practice guideline development.

I earned my BSN with a Research Distinction from UT Health San Antonio, where I researched the impact of nutrition and lifestyle on chronic diseases. This experience fueled my interest in evidence-based practice, leading me to pursue an upcoming MSPH in Outcomes Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

My expertise includes systematic literature reviews, scientific writing, meta-analysis, and statistical analysis. I'm particularly interested in biostatistics, epidemiology, health economics, nutrition, and exercise science.

Outside of work, you can find me shooting hoops, powerlifting, or meditating.

## Some kind words from a close mentor:

> “It is rare to find a human as inquisitive as Louie. He has the soul of a scientist, the heart of a physician, and the cleverness of a crow. His dedication to self-improvement through understanding the scientific principles of biochemistry and research methods is unparalleled. It was a true joy to have Louie in my courses as we constantly encourage mutual curiosity by debating the latest science. I am grateful to count him as a student and friend, and I am honored for him to be a professional colleague in the scientific community.”

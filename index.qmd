Hello there! I'm Louie Neri, a nurse researcher based outside of Chicago, IL. Passionate about evidence-based medicine and nutrition. Currently, I'm a Researcher at Examine.com.

Previously, I was the Senior Coordinator of Evidence Based Surgery at The Society of Thoracic Surgeons where I managed multiple clinical practice guideline projects in cardiothoracic surgery.

I earned my BSN with a Research Distinction from UT Health San Antonio, where I researched the impact of nutrition and lifestyle on chronic diseases. This experience fueled my interest in evidence-based practice, leading me to pursue an upcoming MSPH in Outcomes Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

My expertise lies in evidence appraisal, science communication, and nutrition science. I'm particularly interested in (although not an expert in) biostatistics, epidemiology, health economics, nutrition, and exercise science.

Outside of work, you can find me shooting hoops, powerlifting, or meditating.

## Some kind words from a close mentor:

> “It is rare to find a human as inquisitive as Louie. He has the soul of a scientist, the heart of a physician, and the cleverness of a crow. His dedication to self-improvement through understanding the scientific principles of biochemistry and research methods is unparalleled. It was a true joy to have Louie in my courses as we constantly encourage mutual curiosity by debating the latest science. I am grateful to count him as a student and friend, and I am honored for him to be a professional colleague in the scientific community.”
